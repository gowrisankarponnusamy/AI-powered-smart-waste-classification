## AI-powered-smart-waste-classification
The development of an intelligent waste management system that uses AI-based image classification to automatically identify and sort waste into categories such as plastic, organic, metal, and paper. This solution aims to reduce manual effort, improve recycling efficiency, and promote sustainable waste-handling practices through real-time, automated classification.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
AI-Powered Smart Waste Classification is a project designed to integrate an intelligent waste-sorting system that leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to accurately identify and categorize waste materials. Traditional waste management processes are often inefficient, rely heavily on manual sorting, and lead to improper disposal and reduced recycling effectiveness. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an automated, easy-to-use classification system that assists users in sorting waste correctly. By providing real-time identification of waste types, the system enhances recycling efficiency, reduces human effort, and promotes environmentally sustainable practices.
## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements a deep learning–based waste classification system using image data.
- A framework-based application designed for real-time deployment through webcam input.
- High scalability for adding new waste categories as more data becomes available.
- Low inference time, enabling smooth real-time classification.
- A structured dataset-driven model using folder-based image classes within the project directory.
